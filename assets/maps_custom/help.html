    <title>How to add a custom map</title>
</head>

<body>

    <p> Create your custom maps using the folloing properties in <b>Tiled</b> and then put them in this folder right here <b>('maps_custom')</b>.</p>

    <img src="../../assets/help/help_custom_maps.png" alt="Tiled custom map properties">

    <p>The tileset you will need to create a map in Tiled is called <b>'landscape_tiles.png'</b> and can be found in this project under <b>'assets/tilesets'</b>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can just open an already created map file in Tiled out of this folder: <b>'assets/maps'</b>. This should give you the right configuration.</p>

    <p>You can download Tiled <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html">HERE</a></p>

    <p>Thanks for playing and enjoy your custom maps :)</p>
